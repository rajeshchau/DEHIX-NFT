# DEHIX-NFT

DEHIX-NFT is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Ethereum that leverages blockchain technology to create, manage, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This project is designed to issue NFT certificates, enabling secure, transparent, and decentralized validation of digital credentials.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is provided for educational purposes only. Always perform thorough testing and security audits before deploying any smart contracts to a production environment.

## Overview

DEHIX-NFT is a robust NFT project that utilizes modern development tools such as [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for smart contract compilation, testing, and deployment, along with OpenZeppelinâ€™s secure and battle-tested smart contract libraries. This project supports multiple sale phases (presale with whitelist verification and public sale) and integrates ERC2981 royalties to ensure creators receive a percentage of secondary sales.

---

## Features

- **NFT Certificate Minting:** Create NFTs with unique metadata representing certificates.
- **Sale Phases:** Presale (whitelist-based) and public minting functionality.
- **Royalties:** Integrated ERC2981 standard for automatic royalty distribution.
- **Security:** Implements pausable functionality and reentrancy guard.
- **Administration:** Owner-controlled configuration (mint price, supply cap, whitelist, etc.).
- **Full Deployment & Testing:** Built using Foundry for rapid development and testing.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Smart contract programming language.
- **Foundry:** A fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum development.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Secure, community-vetted smart contract libraries.
- **Node.js:** (Optional) For any frontend or additional tooling.
- **Rust:** (Optional) Required for installing Foundry.

---
